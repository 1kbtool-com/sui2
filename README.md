# SUI2

*a startpage for your server and / or new tab page*

Forked from [sui](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/sui), sui2 adds
new features like keyboard navigation to boost your productivity.
It's a complete refactor, brings new technologies for easier development & deployment.

See how keyboard navigation works in action:

## Deploy to any static hosting

sui2 uses Vite to build a staic website, which means it's nothing but vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript that could be deployed to anywhere you want.

To build the project, simply follow the steps below.

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Create you own `data.json`.

   sui2 get all the data it requires from `data.json`, you can make a copy from `data.example.json`, and then edit it with your own applications and bookmarks.
3. Build the result: `npm run build`

   The result will be stored in the `dist` folder
4. Upload to a static hosting.

   There are various hosting services like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify.
   Examples will be documented later on.

## Deploy using Docker

sui2 provides a Docker image that runs a NodeJS server,
which not only servers the startpage directly,
but also gives you an interface to edit and build the startpage lively.

The image is hosted on Docker hub at: [reorx/sui2](https://hub.docker.com/r/reorx/sui2)

Run the following command to get started:

```
docker run --rm -t -p 3000:3000 -v data:/data reorx/sui2
```

Command explained:

- `-p 3000:3000`: the server runs on port 3000, you need to specify the port on host to expose, if you want to access it from 5000, you can change the argument to `-p 5000:3000`
- `-v data:/data`: you need to attach a volume to `/data`, which stores the config and static resources of startpage


After the container is alive, open `http://HOST:3000` to see the initial startpage.

For the live editor, open `http//HOST:3000/editor`, there's no link for it on the startpage.
